# Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 9, 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how **Maple-Tyne Technologies Inc.** ("Maple-Tyne", "we", "us") collects, uses, and shares information when you use crossword.network (the "Service").

We wrote this policy for crossword.network specifically. If something in here does not match what you see in the product, please tell us so we can correct it.

## 1. What We Collect

### Account information (if you sign in)

When you create an account or sign in, we may collect:

- email address
- name (if provided by you or your sign-in provider)
- authentication identifiers needed to keep you signed in

### Puzzle and gameplay data

To provide the Service features you use, we may store:

- your puzzle progress (cells you filled, timestamps, and save history)
- hints used (for example, Reveal Letter / Reveal Word usage)
- hint usage events (hint type + timestamp) used to enforce hint limits and prevent abuse
- whether a puzzle is completed and completion time stats

### Support messages

If you contact us, we collect the information you send (your email, subject, message, and any details you provide like puzzle IDs).

### Technical data

Like most web services, we may collect basic technical data in server logs, such as:

- IP address (or approximate location derived from it)
- device/browser information (user-agent)
- timestamps and error logs needed to keep the Service reliable

## 2. How We Use Information

We use information to:

- provide the core solving experience (loading puzzles, highlighting, hints)
- save and restore your progress and show your Continue list
- keep your account secure and prevent abuse
- respond to support requests and troubleshoot issues
- improve performance and reliability

We do **not** use your information for marketing emails by default.

## 3. Cookies and Similar Technologies

We use cookies for two purposes:

- **Necessary cookies**: to keep you signed in and protect your session
- **Preference cookies** (optional): to remember settings like theme and solver preferences

See the Cookie Policy for details: `/cookies`.

## 4. When We Share Information

We share information only as needed to operate the Service, including with:

- **Authentication providers** (for example, Google sign-in)
- **Email delivery providers** (for example, to send verification/reset emails and to route support messages)
- **Infrastructure providers** (hosting, databases, and monitoring), as required to run the Service

We do not sell your personal information.

## 5. Data Retention

We keep data for as long as needed to operate the Service.

Examples:

- Account data is retained while your account remains active.
- Puzzle progress is retained so you can continue solving. Unfinished attempts may expire after a period (for example, 7 days) to keep the Continue list relevant.
- Support messages may be retained to help us resolve issues and improve support quality.

## 6. Your Choices and Rights (Canada)

Depending on your location and applicable Canadian privacy laws, you may have rights to:

- request access to personal information we have about you
- request correction of inaccurate information
- request deletion of your account information, subject to legal and operational requirements

To make a privacy request, email: **privacy@crossword.network**

## 7. Security

We use reasonable safeguards to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is perfectly secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. We will update the "Last updated" date at the top when we do.
