# Terms of Service

Last updated: February 9, 2026

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of crossword.network (the "Service").

If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.

## 1. Who We Are

The Service is operated by **Maple-Tyne Technologies Inc.** ("Maple-Tyne", "we", "us", "our").

## 2. The Service (What You Can Do Here)

crossword.network lets you:

- browse and solve crossword puzzles
- use solving tools like **Reveal Letter** and **Reveal Word**
- save progress and continue later (including a list of in-progress puzzles)

Some puzzles are rendered using a third-party puzzle format and are shown inside a sandboxed iframe so that we can support that format while integrating with crossword.network features like highlights and saving.

## 3. Accounts and Access

### Guest play

You may be able to play as a guest. Guest progress is stored on your device/browser and may not carry across devices.

### Signed-in users

If you create an account or sign in, you are responsible for:

- keeping your login credentials secure
- activity that happens under your account

We support authentication methods that may include:

- Google sign-in
- email + password sign-in

### Admin access

Certain features (such as uploading puzzles) are restricted to admin accounts.

## 4. Saving, Continue, and Expiration

The Service includes features to save and continue puzzle progress:

- Autosave may run while you solve.
- You may also see a **Save Now** action to force a save.

To keep the Continue list relevant, unfinished attempts may have an **expiration window** (for example, 7 days). After that, an unfinished attempt may no longer appear in Continue and may be reset.

## 5. Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

- attack, probe, or reverse engineer the Service
- interfere with normal operation (including automated scraping that harms performance)
- upload or distribute malicious code
- attempt to bypass access controls
- use the Service in a way that violates applicable laws

## 6. Puzzle Content and Intellectual Property

### Our content

The Service, including our design, software, and branding, is owned by Maple-Tyne or its licensors and is protected by intellectual property laws.

### Puzzle files

Puzzle files on crossword.network are provided for interactive solving. You may not copy, redistribute, publish, or sell puzzle files unless you have permission from the rights holder.

### Feedback

If you send us feedback (suggestions, bug reports, ideas), you grant us the right to use it to improve the Service without obligation to you.

## 7. Third-Party Services

We may use third-party providers to operate the Service (for example, authentication and email delivery). Your use of those services may be governed by their terms and policies.

## 8. Disclaimers

The Service is provided "as is" and "as available". We do not guarantee that puzzles will always be available, that solving will be uninterrupted, or that the Service will always be error-free.

## 9. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Maple-Tyne will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Service.

## 10. Termination

We may suspend or terminate access to the Service if you violate these Terms or if we must do so to protect the Service, our users, or our providers.

## 11. Governing Law (Canada)

These Terms are governed by the laws of Canada, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes will be handled in the courts of a competent jurisdiction in Canada.
