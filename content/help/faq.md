# FAQ

## Why did my progress disappear?

The most common reasons are:

- You were solving as a **guest** (not signed in). Guest progress is stored on your device and browser. If the browser clears site data (or you use private browsing), progress can be lost.
- Your unfinished attempt passed the **7-day window** for in-progress puzzles and expired.
- Cookies/storage are blocked for crossword.network.

If you are signed in and still seeing this, contact support with the puzzle ID.

## How does Continue Puzzles work?

Continue Puzzles shows puzzles you started but have not finished yet.

- Signed-in users: progress comes from your account in the database.
- Guests: progress is saved in browser storage on that device.

Unfinished attempts may expire after 7 days.

## What does Start Puzzle do?

Start Puzzle is meant to start clean. If you previously started that puzzle, starting fresh should clear the old attempt so you do not accidentally resume it.

## Is autosave always on?

Yes. Autosave runs while you solve and also attempts to save when you leave the page.

You can also click **Save Now** to force a save immediately.

## What do Reveal Letter and Reveal Word do?

- Reveal Letter reveals the currently selected letter.
- Reveal Word reveals the entire selected word.

Hints are tracked so you can see how many you used.

## Can I play without an account?

Yes. You can play as a guest, but guest progress is stored only on your current device/browser.

To continue across devices, sign in.

## Can I switch devices and keep my progress?

If you are signed in, yes. Your progress is saved to your account.

If you are a guest, switching devices will not carry your progress over.

## How often are puzzles added?

Puzzles are added periodically. The Puzzles page will show what is currently available.

## Why is the puzzle in an iframe?

Some puzzles use the EclipseCrossword solver embedded in a sandboxed iframe. This lets crossword.network provide a consistent solving experience (highlighting, hints, saving) while supporting existing puzzle formats.

## How do I report a bug?

Contact support and include:

- puzzle ID (from the URL)
- what device/browser you are using
- what you expected vs what happened
- screenshot if possible
